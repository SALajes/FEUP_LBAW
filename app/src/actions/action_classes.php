     (Stabbing him)     What, you egg?
Young fry of treachery!
FIRST MURDERER

What’s that, you runt? (stabbing him) Young son of a traitor!
SON

80He has killed me, mother.
Run away, I pray you!
SON

He has killed me, Mother. Run away, I beg you!
He dies. Exit LADY MACDUFF, crying “Murder!” followed by MURDERERS
Enter MALCOLM and MACDUFF
MALCOLM and MACDUFF enter.
MALCOLM

Let us seek out some desolate shade and there
Weep our sad bosoms empty.
MALCOLM

Let’s seek out some shady place where we can sit down alone and cry our hearts out.
MACDUFF

     Let us rather
Hold fast the mortal sword and, like good men,
Bestride our downfall'n birthdom. Each new morn
5New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows
Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds
As if it felt with Scotland and yelled out
Like syllable of dolALCOLM

     What I believe I’ll wail;
What know believe, and what I can redress,
10As I shall find the time to friend, I will.
What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.
This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
Was once thought honest. You have loved him well.
He hath not touched you yet. I am young, but something
15You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom
To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb
T' appease an angry god.</p>"

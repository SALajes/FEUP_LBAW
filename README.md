## Tema 2 - Social network

LBrAWl aims to be the most effective communication experience between students. It allows them to share course materials, chat, evaluate peers, teachers, and classes, and even ease the chaotic start of every semester caused by schedule selection and group formation, all in one easy-to-use platform, saving them time, energy and sanity as a result.

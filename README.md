# Data Bases & Web Agents Labs | Laboratório de Bases de Dados e Agentes Web - 2019/2020

Project developed for LBAW curricular unit.

There were ten artifacts (stages of development), from defining the product, user stories and design through site maps and wireflows, to specifying the database (conceptual model, relational schema, etc), to high level architecture and vertical prototype (developing the project with Docker, Laravel and PostgreSQL).

## LBrAWl
### Social network
LBrAWl aims to be the most effective communication experience between students. It allows them to share course materials, chat, evaluate peers, teachers, and classes, and even ease the chaotic start of every semester caused by schedule selection and group formation, all in one easy-to-use platform, saving them time, energy and sanity as a result.
